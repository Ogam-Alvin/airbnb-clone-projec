## Team Roles
1. **Backend Developer**
Designs, develops, and maintains the application's server-side logic. Responsible for implementing RESTful and GraphQL APIs, integrating with the database, managing business logic, and ensuring scalability and security of the backend.

2. **Database Administrator (DBA)**
Designs and manages the relational database schema, ensures data integrity, implements indexing and optimization strategies, handles backup and recovery, and works closely with developers to ensure efficient data access.

3. **DevOps Engineer**
Sets up and maintains CI/CD pipelines using tools like GitHub Actions. Manages infrastructure, Docker containers, deployment automation, monitoring, and ensures high availability and system uptime.

4. **QA Engineer**
Creates and executes test plans for the API and system features. Performs functional, integration, and regression testing. Ensures that the application meets performance, usability, and security standards before deployment.

## Technology Stack
1. **Django**
A high-level Python web framework used to build the core backend logic, define data models, and implement RESTful APIs.

2. **Django REST Framework (DRF)**
An extension of Django that simplifies the creation of RESTful APIs for resources like users, properties, bookings, etc.

3. **GraphQL**
A flexible query language used alongside REST to allow clients to request exactly the data they need from the backend.

4. **PostgreSQL**
A robust, open-source relational database used to store structured data such as user profiles, property listings, bookings, and payments.

5. **Celery**
A distributed task queue used to handle background jobs like sending booking confirmations or processing payments asynchronously.

6. **Redis**
An in-memory data store used for caching frequently accessed data and managing Celery task queues to improve performance.

7. **Docker**
A containerization platform that ensures consistency across development, testing, and production environments.

8. **GitHub Actions**
A CI/CD tool used to automate testing and deployment of backend services whenever code is pushed or merged.

9. **OpenAPI (Swagger)**
A standard for documenting REST APIs, providing clear and interactive documentation for developers and integrators.

## Feature Breakdown
**User Management**
Enables users to register, log in securely, and manage their profiles. This feature ensures each user has a unique identity and access to personalized features like bookings and reviews.
**Property Management**
Allows hosts to create, update, retrieve, and delete property listings. It forms the core of the platform, enabling users to browse and view details of available accommodations.
**Booking System**
Lets users book available properties, view upcoming or past reservations, and manage check-in/check-out details. This feature is essential for the platform’s transactional flow between guests and hosts.
**Payment Processing**
Handles the processing and recording of payments for bookings. It ensures secure transactions between guests and hosts, maintaining financial integrity in the system.
**Review System**
Allows guests to leave ratings and reviews after staying at a property. This promotes trust, transparency, and helps other users make informed decisions when choosing listings.
**API Documentation**
Provides developers with access to REST and GraphQL endpoints using the OpenAPI standard. This ensures smooth integration, maintenance, and scalability for future development.
**Database Optimization**
Includes indexing frequently accessed data and implementing caching mechanisms with Redis. It ensures the backend remains performant and scalable as data grows.

## API Security
Securing the backend API is critical to protect user data, ensure system integrity, and maintain trust between users and the platform. The following key measures are implemented in this project:

✅ Authentication
Authentication ensures that only registered users can access protected endpoints. We use token-based authentication (such as JWT or DRF TokenAuth) to verify user identity with every request. This is essential for securing user sessions and preventing unauthorized access.

✅ Authorization
Once authenticated, authorization determines what actions a user is allowed to perform. Role-based permissions restrict users from modifying or accessing data they don’t own (e.g., only property owners can update their listings). This protects data integrity and enforces user-specific access controls.

✅ Rate Limiting
Rate limiting is applied to prevent abuse of the API through excessive requests. By limiting the number of requests from a single IP or token within a certain time frame, we reduce the risk of denial-of-service (DoS) attacks and improve system stability.

✅ Input Validation and Sanitization
All incoming data is validated using Django serializers and schema definitions. This helps prevent SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and other injection-based vulnerabilities that could compromise the system.

✅ Secure Communication
All API communications are enforced over HTTPS to encrypt data in transit. This prevents sensitive information like login credentials and payment data from being intercepted by attackers.

✅ Data Encryption
Sensitive data (e.g., passwords) are securely hashed and stored using industry-standard algorithms (like PBKDF2 or bcrypt). This protects user data even in the event of a data breach.

✅ Audit Logging
Critical actions like user logins, bookings, and payments are logged to monitor activity and detect suspicious behavior. This supports security audits and helps in incident response.

### Why Security Matters
1. User Data Protection: Personal details such as email addresses and payment methods must be secured to prevent identity theft.

2. Financial Safety: Payment endpoints must be secure to prevent fraud and ensure transactions are trustworthy.

3. System Trust: A secure API builds user trust and ensures compliance with privacy regulations like GDPR.
