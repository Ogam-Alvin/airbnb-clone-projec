## Team Roles
1. **Backend Developer**
Designs, develops, and maintains the application's server-side logic. Responsible for implementing RESTful and GraphQL APIs, integrating with the database, managing business logic, and ensuring scalability and security of the backend.

2. **Database Administrator (DBA)**
Designs and manages the relational database schema, ensures data integrity, implements indexing and optimization strategies, handles backup and recovery, and works closely with developers to ensure efficient data access.

3. **DevOps Engineer**
Sets up and maintains CI/CD pipelines using tools like GitHub Actions. Manages infrastructure, Docker containers, deployment automation, monitoring, and ensures high availability and system uptime.

4. **QA Engineer**
Creates and executes test plans for the API and system features. Performs functional, integration, and regression testing. Ensures that the application meets performance, usability, and security standards before deployment.

## Technology Stack
1. **Django**
A high-level Python web framework used to build the core backend logic, define data models, and implement RESTful APIs.

2. **Django REST Framework (DRF)**
An extension of Django that simplifies the creation of RESTful APIs for resources like users, properties, bookings, etc.

3. **GraphQL**
A flexible query language used alongside REST to allow clients to request exactly the data they need from the backend.

4. **PostgreSQL**
A robust, open-source relational database used to store structured data such as user profiles, property listings, bookings, and payments.

5. **Celery**
A distributed task queue used to handle background jobs like sending booking confirmations or processing payments asynchronously.

6. **Redis**
An in-memory data store used for caching frequently accessed data and managing Celery task queues to improve performance.

7. **Docker**
A containerization platform that ensures consistency across development, testing, and production environments.

8. **GitHub Actions**
A CI/CD tool used to automate testing and deployment of backend services whenever code is pushed or merged.

9. **OpenAPI (Swagger)**
A standard for documenting REST APIs, providing clear and interactive documentation for developers and integrators.

## Feature Breakdown
**User Management**
Enables users to register, log in securely, and manage their profiles. This feature ensures each user has a unique identity and access to personalized features like bookings and reviews.
**Property Management**
Allows hosts to create, update, retrieve, and delete property listings. It forms the core of the platform, enabling users to browse and view details of available accommodations.
**Booking System**
Lets users book available properties, view upcoming or past reservations, and manage check-in/check-out details. This feature is essential for the platformâ€™s transactional flow between guests and hosts.
**Payment Processing**
Handles the processing and recording of payments for bookings. It ensures secure transactions between guests and hosts, maintaining financial integrity in the system.
**Review System**
Allows guests to leave ratings and reviews after staying at a property. This promotes trust, transparency, and helps other users make informed decisions when choosing listings.
**API Documentation**
Provides developers with access to REST and GraphQL endpoints using the OpenAPI standard. This ensures smooth integration, maintenance, and scalability for future development.
**Database Optimization**
Includes indexing frequently accessed data and implementing caching mechanisms with Redis. It ensures the backend remains performant and scalable as data grows.
